# Hello-World-

I am a soon-to-be student of electronics engineering, and at the moment i am only an Arduino-wrecker - or a hobbyist if you will. I wish to learn to code, and rumour had it that i needed an account here on GitHub - apparently a great place! Looking forward to learning more. 

From Norway, studying in Oslo.
